- Understanding 'Gaussian':
  - “Gaussian” refers to the Gaussian (Normal) distribution, one of the most fundamental probability distributions in statistics.
  - It is bell-shaped, symmetric around the mean, and fully described by two parameters:
  - Gaussian (Normal) Distribution Formula: $P(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} \exp \left(-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)$

- Understanding ‘Bayesian’:
  - The term “Bayesian” comes from Bayes’ theorem, a fundamental rule in probability theory.
  - Bayesian methods incorporate prior knowledge and update beliefs as new data arrives.
  - It is widely used in Bayesian statistics, probabilistic modeling, and machine learning algorithms like Bayesian Networks and Bayesian Optimization.
  - Bayesian Theorem Formula: $P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) P(A)}{P(B)}$
