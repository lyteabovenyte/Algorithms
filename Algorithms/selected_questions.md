#### selected questions through-out the problem-solving journey.

1. Given an array of k distinct values, rearrange or repartition them in a way that the distinct values come together in the array. (O(n) time complexity and try to use O(1) additional space)

2. Write a program to compute the minimum number of steps needed to advance to the last location, if we could only advance to the right as the number of value of each index. e.g --> arr = [2, 0, 3, 1, 0, 0, 1], we can advance from the index 0 as the value of arr[0] = 2.

3. Write a program which takes as input a sorted atay A of integers and a positive integer m,
and updates A so that if x appears m times in A it appears exactly min(2, m) times in A. The update
to A should be performed in one pass, and no additional storage may be allocated.
