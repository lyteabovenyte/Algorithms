### element of programming

##### intro:
- [know how to impelment a list with dynamic allocation](https://essinstitute.in/exploring-dynamic-and-static-memory-allocation-in-python/)

- **helpful pdf** [cs.cum.edu lectures](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/academic/class/15850-f20/www/notes/)
(Note: you can change the last part of the url to go to a specific lecture e.g lec11.pdf --> streaming algorithms)

- Apply patterns: **patterns**-general reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems-can
be a good way to approach a baffling problem. Examples include **finding a good data structure**,
seeing if your problem is a good fit for a general algorithmic technique, e.g., **divide-and-conquer**,
**recursion**, or **dynamic programming**, and **mapping** the problem to a **graph**.

#### chapter 1. Primitive Types

- The usage of `^` comes to the **parity**. `XOR` in python.
- The usage of **caching** in comutative and associative operations
- **remember the tricks of `x & (x - 1)` vs `x & ~(x - 1)`**
