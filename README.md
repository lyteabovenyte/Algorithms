# Algorithms and Data Structures

##### noticable algorithms:


###### Intermediate:
- [X] generating **Uniformed random** permutation and subsets for feature roll-out to users.
- [X] generating **NONUniformed random** request to servers to test inter-arrival times on request distribution.
- [X] **Spiral_Ordering** in N dimensional arrays with pure python and processing the arrays in *shells* by controling the direction plus multiple exporation on 2D arrays such as rotation and layer by layer exploration and pascal's triangle
- [X] implemented [CStyle arrays](Algorithms/String/merge_sorted_arrays.py) (`ctypes`) and **Custom Array Class with preallocated memory** with handy sorts of **magic methods**.
- [X] returning valid IP addresses. ( also can be used with IPLocation service to examine the location of the IP addresses in data pipelines.)
- [X] string-search using **rabin-krap** algorithm for linear-time complexity.[source](/Intermediate/String/string_search_algorithm.py)
- [X] **Floydâ€™s Tortoise and Hare algorithm** (also called the cycle detection algorithm)
- [X] Multiple **Queue** classes for different use cases.
- [X] Multiple approaches for both ***Recursive*** and ***Iterative*** traversals of Trees plus balancing, completeness and more
- [X] Computing **LCA** (lowest-common-ancestor); it is an essential calculation when rendering web pages, specifically when computing the *Cascading Style Sheet* (CSS) that is applicable to a particular _Document Object Model_ (DOM)
- [X] Often data is almost sorted. for example a server receives timestamped stock quotes and earlier quotes may arrive slightly after later quotes becuase of the difference in server loads and network routes. so implementing sorting algorithms based on **heap** data structure could be the most efficient way of sorting almost sorted *streams*

###### Advanced:
- [X] full implementation of **heap** and **Priority Queues**
- [X] full implementation of **huffman Trees** and **huffman encoding** techniques
- [X] full implementation of **Bloom-filter** (similar to HashSet API) using **Cython** and **python** plus variants hashing mathodology used in HashTables (*chaining* and *open-addressing*) + implementing a very tiny email app to poppup 'save contant' if the recipient is not seen.
