# Algorithms and Data Structures

##### noticable algorithms:
- [X] generating **Uniformed random** permutation and subsets for feature roll-out to users.
- [X] generating **NONUniformed random** request to servers to test inter-arrival times on request distribution.
- [X] **Spiral_Ordering** in N dimensional arrays with pure python and processing the arrays in *shells* by controling the direction plus multiple exporation on 2D arrays such as rotation and layer by layer exploration and pascal's triangle
