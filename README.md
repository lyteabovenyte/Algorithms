# Algorithms and Data Structures

##### noticable algorithms:


###### Intermediate:
- [X] generating **Uniformed random** permutation and subsets for feature roll-out to users.
- [X] generating **NONUniformed random** request to servers to test inter-arrival times on request distribution.
- [X] **Spiral_Ordering** in N dimensional arrays with pure python and processing the arrays in *shells* by controling the direction plus multiple exporation on 2D arrays such as rotation and layer by layer exploration and pascal's triangle
- [X] implemented [CStyle arrays](Algorithms/String/merge_sorted_arrays.py) (`ctypes`) and **Custom Array Class with preallocated memory** with handy sorts of **magic methods**.
- [X] returning valid IP addresses. ( also can be used with IPLocation service to examine the location of the IP addresses in data pipelines.)
- [X] string-search using **rabin-krap** algorithm for linear-time complexity.[source](/Intermediate/String/string_search_algorithm.py)
- [X] **Floydâ€™s Tortoise and Hare algorithm** (also called the cycle detection algorithm)
- [X] Multiple **Queue** classes for different use cases.


###### Advanced:
- [X] full implementation of **heap** and **Priority Queues**
- [X] full implementation of **huffman Trees** and **huffman encoding** techniques
