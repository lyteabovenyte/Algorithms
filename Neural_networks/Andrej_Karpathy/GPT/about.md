### What is a Transformer?
A transformer is a type of neural network commonly used in natural language processing (NLP). It’s designed to understand and generate text by paying **attention** to relationships between words in a sequence. Unlike older models (like RNNs), transformers process all words at once (in parallel), which makes them faster and better at capturing long-range dependencies in text.

This specific code builds a **decoder-only transformer** that predicts the next character in a sequence (a "language model"). It’s trained on text from `input.txt` and learns to generate text one character at a time.

### Key Concepts Before the Code
1. **Tokens**: In this code, tokens are individual characters (not words). The model converts text into a sequence of numbers (indices) using a vocabulary (`stoi` and `itos`).
2. **Embeddings**: Numbers (token IDs) are turned into dense vectors that represent meaning or position.
3. **Attention**: The model figures out which parts of the input sequence are important for predicting the next character.
4. **Layers**: Transformers stack multiple processing layers (attention + feedforward) to refine their understanding.

### Code Breakdown: The Classes

#### 1. `BigramLanguageModel` (The Main Model)
This is the top-level class that ties everything together.
- **Purpose**: Predicts the next character in a sequence.
- **Key Parts**:
  - `token_embedding_table`: Converts each character into a vector (size `n_embd=384`).
  - `position_embedding_table`: Adds information about where each character is in the sequence (e.g., 1st, 2nd, 3rd).
  - `blocks`: A sequence of transformer "blocks" (explained below) that process the input.
  - `lm_head`: Converts the final output back into probabilities over the vocabulary (e.g., which character comes next).

- **How it Works** (`forward` method):
  1. Takes a sequence of character indices (e.g., `[5, 2, 1]`).
  2. Turns them into embeddings (vectors).
  3. Adds positional information.
  4. Passes them through transformer blocks.
  5. Outputs "logits" (scores for each possible next character).
  6. If training, calculates loss (how wrong the predictions are compared to the true next characters).

- **Generation** (`generate` method):
  - Starts with a small context (like `[0]`).
  - Predicts the next character, adds it to the sequence, and repeats.

#### 2. `Block` (Transformer Layer)
- **Purpose**: A single "layer" of the transformer that processes the input.
- **Why it’s here**: Transformers stack multiple blocks to gradually refine their understanding of the sequence.
- **Key Parts**:
  - `sa` (Self-Attention): Looks at relationships between all characters in the sequence.
  - `ffwd` (FeedForward): Processes each character’s representation individually.
  - `ln1`, `ln2` (LayerNorm): Normalizes the data to stabilize training.

- **How it Works**:
  1. **Communication**: Self-attention lets each character "look at" others to gather context.
  2. **Computation**: The feedforward layer refines each character’s representation.
  3. **Residual Connections** (`x + ...`): Adds the input back to the output to prevent information loss.

---

#### 3. `MultiHeadAttention` (Multiple Attention Heads)
- **Purpose**: Runs several "attention" mechanisms in parallel to capture different types of relationships.
- **Why it’s here**: One attention mechanism might not catch everything—multiple "heads" (6 in this case) look at the sequence from different perspectives.
- **Key Parts**:
  - `heads`: A list of `Head` objects (each doing attention).
  - `proj`: Combines the results back into the original size (`n_embd`).
  - `dropout`: Randomly drops some values during training to prevent overfitting.

- **How it Works**:
  - Splits the input into 6 parts (one per head).
  - Each head computes attention independently.
  - Concatenates the results and projects them back to the original size.

---

#### 4. `Head` (Single Attention Mechanism)
- **Purpose**: Implements "self-attention," the core of transformers.
- **Why it’s here**: Attention lets the model focus on relevant parts of the sequence (e.g., "the" might care about "cat" earlier in "the cat").
- **Key Parts**:
  - `key`, `query`, `value`: Linear layers that transform the input into three different representations.
  - `tril`: A triangular matrix to ensure the model only looks at previous characters (not future ones—important for prediction).

- **How it Works**:
  1. **Query (q)**: What am I looking for?
  2. **Key (k)**: What do other characters offer?
  3. **Value (v)**: What information do I take from them?
  4. Computes attention scores (`wei = q @ k.transpose...`) to decide which characters matter.
  5. Masks future positions (using `tril`) so it only attends to past characters.
  6. Applies softmax to get weights and multiplies by `v` to get the output.

---

#### 5. `FeedForward` (Per-Token Processing)
- **Purpose**: Adds "thinking" power to each character’s representation after attention.
- **Why it’s here**: Attention handles relationships; this layer processes each character individually.
- **Key Parts**:
  - A simple neural network: `Linear → ReLU → Linear → Dropout`.
  - Expands the size (`4 * n_embd`), applies ReLU (non-linearity), then shrinks back.

- **How it Works**:
  - Takes the output of attention.
  - Processes it through the network to refine it.

---

### Training Loop
- **What it does**: Trains the model on batches of text from `input.txt`.
- **Key Steps**:
  1. `get_batch`: Grabs random chunks of text (e.g., 256 characters, `block_size`).
  2. `estimate_loss`: Checks how well the model is doing on training and validation data.
  3. For each iteration:
     - Gets a batch.
     - Computes loss (how wrong the predictions are).
     - Updates the model weights using the optimizer (`AdamW`).

---

### Why These Classes Together?
- **Head**: Basic attention mechanism.
- **MultiHeadAttention**: Combines multiple attention perspectives.
- **FeedForward**: Adds individual token processing.
- **Block**: Combines attention and feedforward into one transformer layer.
- **BigramLanguageModel**: Ties it all together into a full model.

This structure mimics the original transformer paper ("Attention is All You Need") but simplifies it:
- It’s decoder-only (no encoder, since it’s just generating text).
- It uses characters instead of words.
- It’s a "bigram" model in name but actually more powerful due to attention.

### Example Flow
Imagine the input is "hel":
1. Converted to indices: `[7, 4, 11]` (via `stoi`).
2. Turned into embeddings (384D vectors).
3. Attention: "h" looks at itself, "e" looks at "h", "l" looks at "h" and "e".
4. Feedforward refines each character’s representation.
5. Repeated across 6 blocks.
6. Final layer predicts the next character (e.g., "l" → "o" for "hello").
