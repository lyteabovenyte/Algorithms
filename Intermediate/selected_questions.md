#### selected questions through-out the problem-solving journey.

- [ ] Given an array of k distinct values, rearrange or repartition them in a way that the distinct values come together in the array. (O(n) time complexity and try to use O(1) additional space)

- [ ]  Write a program to compute the minimum number of steps needed to advance to the last location, if we could only advance to the right as the number of value of each index. e.g --> arr = [2, 0, 3, 1, 0, 0, 1], we can advance from the index 0 as the value of arr[0] = 2.

- [ ]  Write a program which takes as input a sorted atay A of integers and a positive integer m,
and updates A so that if x appears m times in A it appears exactly min(2, m) times in A. The update
to A should be performed in one pass, and no additional storage may be allocated.

- [ ] Given an array of stock prices, compute the max profit made by buying and selling at most twice. note that the second by must be after the first sell. variant(p. 48)
solve it in O(n) time and O(1) space.

- [ ] Given an array A and a permutation P, Apply P to A.
p = [2, 0, 1, 3] --> move index 0 to index 2, move index 1 to index 0,
move index 2 to index 1, move index 3 to index 3 (uncahnged).

- [ ] Given an array A of integers representing a permutation, update A to represent the inverse permutation using only constant additional storage


- [ ] Compute the Kth permutation under dictionary ordering, starting from the identity permutation (which is the first permutation in dictionary ordering)

- [ ] Given a permutation p, return the permutaiton corresponding to the previous permutation of p under dictionary ordering.

- [ ] return the majority element without using HashMap. majority is the element with occurence more than len(array) // 2 -it is guaranteed we have one majority element. **150Leetcode**

- [ ] Given an n X n 2D array, return the elements in the spiral ordering.

- [ ] Write a function that takes an n X n 2D array, and rotate the array by 90 degrees clockwise.

- [ ] convert base function.

- [ ] spreadsheet columns to the corresponding integer. with 'A' corresponding to 0. (Strings/spreadsheet_encoding.py)

- [ ] Given an array of characters, the character can be digits, letters, blanks and punctuation,
return the telex_encoding of the array. (punctuations are spelled out) *(72-epi)*

- [ ] the step-by-step recursive approach of mnemonic phone numbers. [/Intermediat/String/mnemonic_phone_number.py](answer)

- [ ] Given a decimal string which denotes ip addresses and an integer k which denotes the number
of periods in ip addresses, imagine the string's length in unbounded,
return all the possible valid IP addresses with k periods in between.

- [ ] try to implement string matching algorithm(rabin-krap) with additive hash function

- [ ] Given a linkedlist and a nonnegative integer k, reverse the list k nodes at a time, if k is not a multiply of n, leave the last n mod k nodes unchanged.[/Intermediate/LinkedList/variant_reverse_K_node_at_a_time.py](source)

- [ ] cycalically right shift a linkedlist by k.

- [ ] Given two singly linkedlist, return the list corresponding to the sum of the integers they represent. the least significant digit comes first.
e.g:  3 -> 1 -> 4  &  7 -> 0 -> 9   -->   0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1
