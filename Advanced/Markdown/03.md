#### Treaps - the best of two worlds, trees and heaps
- we can have the `search` of tree and the `top()` and `peek()` benefits of heaps
- How Treaps Work (Probabilistic Balancing)
  - Treaps are BSTs with an additional “priority” value for each node. These priority values are randomly assigned (typically drawn from a uniform distribution).
  - Each node follows two rules:
    - Binary Search Tree (BST) Property: Left child < Parent < Right child (based on key).
    - Heap Property: Parent has a higher priority than its children.
  - Key Idea: The random priority values determine the tree structure, not the insert order of keys! This randomization ensures balance in an expected way, rather than enforcing it explicitly.
  - worth noting that binary search trees offer the best average performance across all standard operations (`insert`, `delete`, `search`)
