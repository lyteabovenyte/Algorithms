#### concept for future research.

- [ ] *Dijkstra* and *A** algorithm on graph which compute the minimum path to a vertex. how can *heap* make this algorithms better?
- [ ] more on *Prim's algorihms* and *MST* (Minimum Spanning Tree)
- [ ] *Fibonacci heap*
- [ ] what is prefix code? which is a the key in decoding huffman codes.(no code is the prefix of the other code)
